**Details** 

Amazon Smart Plug lets you voice control your lights, fans, coffee makers, and more. All you need is an Alexa-enabled device like Echo, Fire TV, or even just the Alexa app on your phone. With multiple Amazon Smart Plugs, you can control multiple outlets. Use the Alexa app to create routines for your Amazon Smart Plug that make life easier. For example, set a morning routine that turns on lights and your coffee maker with a single request.	

**Things to try**

* This plug is setup to control the lamp fixture on the bookshelf. At a nearby Alexa Built-In device say, *"Alexa, turn on edison light"*.

.. note::
    This device is plugged into a power strip below the bookshelf and may be difficult to see physically.
