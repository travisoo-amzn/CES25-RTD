**Details** 

Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor makes it easy to understand what‚Äôs in your indoor air. Get an indication of current air quality from the color-coded LED, and an easy-to-understand air quality score in the Alexa app anytime. If Alexa detects poor air quality, you can get notifications on your phone or even announcements on Echo devices.	

**Things to try**

* There are no direct interactions with this product, however if poor air quality is detected, we've configured an Alexa Routine to be triggered which will increase the speed of a nearby air purifier.

* You can also ask a nearby Alexa Built-in device for the current air quality; just say, *"Alexa, what's the indoor air quality?"*.
