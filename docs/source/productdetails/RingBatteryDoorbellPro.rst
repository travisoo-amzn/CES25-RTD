**Details** 

Battery Doorbell Pro with Head-to-Toe HD+ Video gives you an expanded field of view so you can see more of who‚Äôs at your door. Enjoy motion detection, privacy zones and see who stops by at night with Color Night Vision. Pair with Alexa devices to enable pre-recorded announcements and Two-Way Talk for convenient in-home monitoring. With a Ring Protect plan, Alexa can also make custom voice announcements and automatically show live video feed on an Echo Show, Fire TV, or Fire Tablet when your Ring doorbell detects a person or package.	

**Things to try**

* On an Echo Show device inside the Day 1 Home Lab, you can view the doorbell feed by saying, *"Alexa, show the front door canera"*.

* When someone rings the doorbell, Alexa will announce that someone is at the door and supported screen-based devices will pop-up a live view of the doorbell's camera feed.
