**Details** 

The Roomba Combo j7+ is the only 2-in-1 with a mop that lifts itself to the top of the robot, completely away from carpet preventing wet messes entirely. On hard floors, it vacuums and mops at the same time. The 4-Stage Cleaning system combines our Edge-Sweeping Brush, Dual Multi-Surface Rubber Brushes, Power-Lifting Suction and first-of-its-kind mopping. Pair it with Alexa-enabled devices and say commands like "Tell Roomba Combo to clean under the table."	

**Things to try**

*"Alexa, start Roomba"*

*"Alexa, tell Roomba to go home"*

.. note::
    Please stop the Roomba at the end of the demostration, otherwise it will continue to roam around!
