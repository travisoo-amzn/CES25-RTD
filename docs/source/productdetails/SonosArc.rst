**Details** 

Customers can activate Alexa and/or Sonos Voice Control on the same supported Sonos device by simply saying the corresponding wake word (i.e., “Alexa” or “Hey Sonos”). They can choose which assistant to use based on the most appropriate use case. Sonos Voice Control, for instance, can assist with multi-room music and system controls, and Alexa can help customers update their grocery list, check the weather, set timers, lock the door, and more.

**Things to try**

*"Hey Sonos, play Amazon Music"*

*"Alexa, stop (music)"*
