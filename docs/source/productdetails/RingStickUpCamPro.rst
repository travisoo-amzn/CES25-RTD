**Details** 

Know like a pro, outside or in. Add security inside or out with the go-anyplace, see-everything Stick Up Cam Pro. Watch over your deck with 3D Motion Detection and Color Night Vision. Or mount it on a mantle to check in on home from afar with HDR video and enhanced Two-Way Talk. Combine Ring Stick Up Cam Pro with Alexa for hands-free home monitoring. When anyone triggers Ring‚Äôs built-in motion zones, your Echo device will illuminate and make an announcement, so you‚Äôll always know when someone‚Äôs there. And if you have an Echo Show, you can also see, hear and speak to anyone captured on camera.

**Things to try**

* On an Echo Show device inside, you see the camera's live view by saying, *"Alexa, show the patio camera"*
