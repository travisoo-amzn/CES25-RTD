**Details** 

Introducing Echo Show 10, our HD smart display designed to move with you. Move around the room during video calls or while you're cooking along to a recipe and the brilliant 10.1” HD screen will automatically turn to face you. Using auto-framing, the 13MP camera can pan and zoom to make sure you and your family are front and center.

Enable Conversation Mode by saying, *“Alexa, turn on Conversation Mode”* or *“Alexa, join the conversation.”* Once the mode is enabled, anyone in the room can speak with Alexa without saying the wake word, as long as they’re in view of the device’s camera and looking toward the screen.

**Things to try**

*"Alexa, add milk, eggs and fabric softener to my shopping list"*

*"Alexa, I'm home"*

**For Conversation mode, try...**

*"Alexa, turn on Conversation Mode"*

*"Alexa, join the conversation"*
