Allow your evenings in your home to become safer. Ambient technologies help give you more peace of mind that comes from knowing that your loved ones are healthy and sound. You can check on your driveway and yard with the Blink Outdoor 4 Floodlight Camera, and make sure everything is safe and secure. Your Ford F-150 Lightning with Alexa built-in allows you to control our all your smart home devices with your voice, from the car. Park and plug your truck into the Autel MaxiCharger Smart EV Charger to manage, schedule, and optimize EV charging anytime to take advantage of off-peak electricity rates. When the day is done, lock up at night with the Yale Assure Lock SL with Matter from anywhere by adding the lock to Alexa to sleep safe and securely
