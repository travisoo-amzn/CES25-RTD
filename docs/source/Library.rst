Allow your child’s life to become brighter in the rec room of the Amazon Experience Area. Watch their imaginations light up as they interact with the Echo Pop Kids. Discover how kids can ask Alexa to play music over the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar while studying for a quiz on their Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids tablet. Play the latest games via the Luna Controller on your Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED. And it’s easier than ever to make sure your kids are healthy: the Levoit Vital 200S Air Purifier will help to ensure the air is always fresh, which is especially helpful during cold and flu season. When it’s bedtime, parents can help them transition into a world of sweet dreams by reading Owl & Dragon, A Magical Adventure with Alexa and the kids, and setting the mood for wonder via the SONOFF TX Ultimate Smart Switch.
