Impulse Induction Cooktop
-----

üü¶ `Product Detail Page <https://www.impulselabs.com/>`_

**Details** 

The Impulse 30 inch Induction Cooktop - not only offers best in class performance, but is designed with innovative and cutting edge, proprietary features, and user-centric experiences that up level any cooking experience. Proprietary temperature sensing technology in each 9 inch induction burner bring a new degree of precision and accuracy to everyday cooking. With burners that have 10kW peak performance, you can boil 1L of water 3x faster than top induction stoves and 10x faster than gas. Building a battery into the appliance removes common installation friction by enabling it to work with a standard 120V or 240V outlet, the battery functions as back-up power for the stove if there‚Äôs an outage.

* Best-in-class, high performance induction cooktop
* Induction stove with proprietary temperature sensing technology built into each, Ô¨Årst-party heating element.
* About 3x faster than high-end induction stoves and 10x faster than high-end gas stoves.
* Easy to use, easy to install;no need for expensive panel upgrades or rewiring
* Induction cooktops traditionally require higher electrical power, and for about 30% of homes in America that have gas stoves, installing an induction stove means serious (and expensive) electrical upgrades. Thanks to the battery, the ImpulseCooktop requires less power to run, and works on with your current wiring and standard outlet.
* Large interface for legibility, removable knobs for ease of use and cleaning(no more Ô¨Ånicky touch screens).
* Good for you, good for the environment: reduce emissions and transition to clean energy
* Gas stoves emit dangerous pollutants known to causeAsthma in children and contaminants into the air, these fumes are bad for the environment as well and are major contributors to climate change.
* The built-in battery allows for load-shifting; which means charging the battery when it‚Äôs cheap and clean (generated by renewable resource) for use when energy demand is higher (and often pulled from non-renewable sources)
* Impulse is building battery-integrated home appliances to make it easier to install and use electric appliances, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels/gas. The battery is built into the product and designed to work as part of the appliance (this is NOT a standalone battery-powered product that doesn‚Äôt require a plug). The embedded battery removes installation friction by reducing amperage requirements for appliances, provides back-up power for the appliance, and adds incremental energy storage to homes.
* Future looking, Impulse intends to build more battery-integrated appliances to replace other gas-using appliances in the home such as ovens, water heaters, and more.
* CES announcement: Impulse is now taking limited deposits for $249 on their website to secure one of the Ô¨Årst induction cooktop units which expect to ship in Q4 2024 (total price is $5,999, limited early orders are discounted to $5,499)
