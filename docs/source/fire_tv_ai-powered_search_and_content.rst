**Details** 

Amazon has enhanced Fire TV with an AI-powered search feature, enabling users to discover content using natural language.

Development of AI-Powered Search:
* Semantic Search Implementation: Transitioned from keyword-based to semantic search, allowing understanding of complex queries like "movies about dog and human friendships." 
* Integration with Alexa's Knowledge Base: Leveraged Alexa's extensive data to interpret diverse entertainment-related searches, enhancing user interaction. 
* Machine Learning for Result Ranking: Employed machine learning models to improve the relevance and personalization of search results based on user preferences. 


Using the AI-Enhanced Search:
* Voice-Activated Search: Press the Alexa or microphone button on the Fire TV remote and issue commands like "Show me movies based on video games." 
* Hands-Free Operation: On devices with far-field microphones, such as Fire TV Omni QLED Series or Fire TV Cube, users can search without the remote by speaking commands aloud. 
* Personalized Results: Search outcomes are tailored to individual profiles, considering subscribed streaming services and viewing habits. 
* Content Exploration: Users can view detailed information about titles, including synopsis, ratings, and availability, directly from the search results. 
* This AI-driven enhancement simplifies content discovery on Fire TV, making it more intuitive and aligned with user preferences.
